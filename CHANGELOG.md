### [0.3.0] - 2026-04-18

#### Fixed

- `POST /v1/books` no longer crashes with an empty TCP reply when Calibre's
  hook system tries to update Qt widgets from the background HTTP thread.
  `add_books` is now called with `run_hooks=False` to avoid unsafe
  cross-thread GUI access.
- After a successful add the GUI library view is refreshed via
  `QTimer.singleShot(0, ...)` on the main thread so new books appear without
  requiring a manual Ctrl+R.

### [0.1.0] - 2026-04-17

Initial release.

- HTTP server (`ThreadingHTTPServer`) starts in `genesis()` and stops in
  `shutting_down()`, bound to configurable host/port (default
  `127.0.0.1:8099`).
- `GET /v1/health` returns plugin version, Calibre version, and active
  library path.
- `POST /v1/books` accepts `{"path": "..."}` and adds the book via
  `db.new_api.add_books` with `add_duplicates=False`. Returns `201` on add,
  `409` on duplicate, `401` without a valid bearer token, `503` during a
  library swap.
- Configuration dialog (Preferences -> Plugins -> Bindery Bridge ->
  Customize) stores `port`, `bind_host`, `api_key` via `JSONConfig`.
